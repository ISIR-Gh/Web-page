I am a software engineer focused on designing and building scalable, reliable, and maintainable web systems. My journey in engineering began back in senior high school when I joined the IT club and was introduced to Python and HTML. The ability to bring logic to life in a browser not only sparked my curiosity but also shaped my long-term direction into system-level web engineering.
